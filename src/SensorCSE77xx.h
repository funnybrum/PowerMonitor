 * Driver and user-friendly interface for the CSE7789B sensor. Both the CSE7766
 * and the CSE7789B seems to have identical serial communicaton protocol.
 * 
 * The Sonoff Pow R2 has the CS7789B TI (the UART TX) pin connected to the
 * ESP8266EX U0RXD (the hardware UART RX) pin. Because of that the
 * implementation is based on the hardware serial support.
 * 
 * Based on the CSE7766.pdf that can be found in the docs folder.
